# Post-Prediction-Inference

# Statistical Methods for the Analysis of EHR data

## Overview

This course aims to provide an introduction to the statisical inference when outcomes and/or covariates are generated from a machine learning (ML) model.  As a starting point, we will consider the classical measurement error and misclassification literature.  We will then work on a method for M-estimation in the semi-supervised setting with error prone outcomes and covariates (SEP). You will be responsible for running simulation studies to evaluate the performance of the method and to build and R

## Overview

In weeks 1-6, articles will be assigned and written reflection is required.  Guidance on how to read and respond to an academic paper can be found [here](https://github.com/jlgrons/EHR_Reading_Course/tree/main/Article%20Reviews).

In weeks 7-13, you will be responsible for understanding a new method for high-dimensional regression in the PU setting and running simulation studies to better understand its performance.  You will be given code to implement the method which can be found [here](https://github.com/jlgrons/EHR_Reading_Course/tree/main/SAPUL).
