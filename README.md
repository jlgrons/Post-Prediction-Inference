# Post-Prediction-Inference

## Overview

This course aims to provide an introduction to the statisical inference when outcomes and/or covariates are generated from a machine learning (ML) model.  As a starting point, we will consider the classical measurement error and misclassification literature.  We will then work on a method for M-estimation in the semi-supervised setting with error prone outcomes and covariates (SEP). You will be responsible for running simulation studies to evaluate the performance of the method and to build and R
